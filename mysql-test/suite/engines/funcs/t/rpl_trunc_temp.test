# leaves the table open on a slave
#

create temporary table t1 (n int);
insert into t1 values(1);
sync_slave_with_master;
show status like 'Slave_open_temp_tables';

# Perform a delete from temp table
connection master;
delete from t1;
sync_slave_with_master;
show status like 'Slave_open_temp_tables';

connection master;
truncate t1;
sync_slave_with_master;
