# Tests for the performance schema

# =============
# DOCUMENTATION
# =============

# Verify how table io is aggregated into various tables
#
# In the instance dimension:
# - table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
# - table_io_waits_summary_by_table
# - table_lock_waits_summary_by_table
# - objects_summary_global_by_type
#
# In the thread dimension:
# - events_waits_summary_by_thread_by_event_name
#
# Globally:
# - events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name
#
# The tests are written with the following helpers:
# - include/table_aggregate_setup.inc
# - include/table_aggregate_load.inc
# - include/table_aggregate_cleanup.inc
#
# Helpers are intended to be used as follows.
#
# A Typical test t/table_aggregate_xxx.test will consist of:
# --source ../include/table_aggregate_setup.inc
# 
# ... statements to modify the default configuration ...
#
# --source ../include/table_aggregate_load.inc
# --source ../include/table_aggregate_cleanup.inc
#
# Naming conventions for t/table_aggregate_xxx.test are as follows:
# t/<instrument>aggregate_<mode><actors><objects>
#
# <instrument> corresponds to different instruments settings
# - table: both table io and table lock are instrumented
# - table_io: only table io is instrumented
# - table_lock: only table lock is instrumented
#
# <mode> corresponds to different consumers settings
# - off: global_instrumentation OFF
# - global: global_instrumentation ON, thread_instrumentation OFF
# - thread: global_instrumentation ON, thread_instrumentation ON,
#           events_* consumers OFF
# - history: global_instrumentation ON, thread_instrumentation ON,
#           events_* consumers ON
#
# <actors> corresponds to different setup_actors settings
# - 4u: every test user (user1, user2, user3, user4) is ON
# - 2u: (user1, user3) are ON, (user2, user4) are OFF
#
# <objects> corresponds to different setup_objects settings
# - 3t: tables t1, t2 and t3 are ON
# - 2t: tables t1 and t3 are ON, table t2 is OFF
