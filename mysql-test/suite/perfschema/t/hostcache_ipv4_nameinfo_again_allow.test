# Test scenario: (con2)
# - a client connects on a TCP/IPv4 socket
# - the client IPv4 can be obtained (temp failure)
# - the client IPv4 is not in the cache
# - the client hostname can not be obtained
# - there are grants for the client IP
# Test results:
# - connection is accepted
# - user is authorized by IP
# - peer_addr_error is unchanged
# - the host_cache records the failing IP with no hostname
