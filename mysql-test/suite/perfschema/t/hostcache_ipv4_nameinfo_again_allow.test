# Tests for the performance_schema host_cache.
#
# Test scenario:
# - a client connects on a TCP/IPv4 socket
# - the client IPv4 can be obtained (temp failure)
# - the client hostname can not be obtained
# - there are grants for the client IP
# Test results:
# - connection is accepted
# - peer_addr_error is unchanged
# - the host_cache records the failing IP with no hostname
#

# [Warning] IP address '192.0.2.4' could not be resolved:
# Temporary failure in name resolution
