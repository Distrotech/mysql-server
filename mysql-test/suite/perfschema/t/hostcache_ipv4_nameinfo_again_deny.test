# Tests for the performance_schema host_cache.
#
# Test scenario: (con2)
# - a client connects on a TCP/IPv4 socket
# - the client IPv4 can be obtained
# - the client IPv4 is not in the cache
# - the client hostname can not be obtained (temp failure)
# - there are no grants for the client IP
# Test results:
# - connection is refused
# - peer_addr_errors is unchanged
# - the host_cache records the failing IP with no hostname
